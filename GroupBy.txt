[This having is just like where but it is only to be used with group by. Because if you think of it then you can understand that when we say 'select * from table', it goes through the whole table for once and then it shows the results. So, when we say 'select * from table where condition', it checks for the condition for each and every entry in the table once, if it satisfies then is displays the result otherwise not. But when we use group by like 'select * from employee group by field' the table can be imagined as divided by the field given after group by clause. And from that sub-table (divided table by the given field) if we want to get results based on condition, we use having instead of where. In simple words, where works on the whole table and having works on the sub-table that is divided by the field given after group by clause]

Ex3. Find out the details of the employees who belongs to such cities from where greater than one employees belong to. But don't show results from city Gurgaon.
ANS:
select * from employee 
where city in(select city from employee group by city 
	having count(*) > 1 and city <> 'Gurgaon')order by city;
