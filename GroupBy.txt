query: select city from employee group by city;
output: 
CITY
----------
Bihar
Gurgaon
Mumbai
Kolkata
Gujrat

[Only the field that is used with group by is to be given after select keyword. Otherwise only aggregate functions are allowed and no other fields.]

Ex1. Display the number of employees who belong to a city along with the cityname.
ANS:
SQL> select city, count(*) from employee group by city;

CITY         COUNT(*)
---------- ----------
Bihar               1
Gurgaon             2
Mumbai              1
Kolkata             2
Gujrat              1

Ex2. Find out the details of the employees who belongs to such cities from where greater than one employees belong to.
ANS:
select * from employee 
where city in(select city from employee group by city 
	having count(*) > 1)order by city;

[This having is just like where but it is only to be used with group by. Because if you think of it then you can understand that when we say 'select * from table',
it goes through the whole table for once and then it shows the results. So, when we say 'select * from table where condition', it checks for the condition for
each and every entry in the table once, if it satisfies then is displays the result otherwise not. But when we use group by like 'select * from employee group by
field' the table can be imagined as divided by the field given after group by clause. And from that sub-table (divided table by the given field) if we want to
get results based on condition, we use having instead of where. In simple words, where works on the whole table and having works on the sub-table that is divided
by the field given after group by clause]

Ex3. Find out the details of the employees who belongs to such cities from where greater than one employees belong to. But don't show results from city Gurgaon.
ANS:
select * from employee 
where city in(select city from employee group by city 
	having count(*) > 1 and city <> 'Gurgaon')order by city;

E_ID  NAME                     SALARY CITY       DOB
----- -------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------
E07   Ajay                       3000 Kolkata    12-JAN-00

_________________________________________
 GROUP BY CLAUSE ON MORE THAN ONE COLUMN
-----------------------------------------
create table names(
	firstname varchar2(10),
	lastname varchar2(10)
);

insert into names values(
	'pritam',
	'das'
);
insert into names values(
	'pritam',
	'nandi'
);
insert into names values(
	'subham',
	'das'
);
insert into names values(
	'subham',
	'das'
);

This is the table:-
FIRSTNAME  LASTNAME
---------- ----------
pritam     das
pritam     nandi
subham     das
subham     das

SQL> select firstname from names group by firstname;

FIRSTNAME
----------
pritam
subham

SQL> select lastname from names group by lastname;

LASTNAME
----------
nandi
das

SQL> select (firstname||' '||lastname) as "Fullname", count(*) from names group by firstname, lastname;

Fullname                COUNT(*)
--------------------- ----------
subham das                     2
pritam nandi                   1
pritam das                     1

[It is same with group by clause as in the case with primary keys that if we select more than one fields to be primary key then their combined value gives out
the unique value. For example, in the above table when only firstname is given after the group by clause, two pritams are considered to be same and two subhams
are also considered to be same and similar schenario happens with lastname after group by clause. But when both firstname and lastname are given after group by
clause, their combined values are considered. Like, pritam das and pritam nandi are now distinct and both subham dasses are same.]

Ex1. Give out the name and id of the employee along with the number of departments assigned to them

ANS:
select e.e_id, e.name, count(*) as "No. of deps. assigned" from employee e, work w where w.eid = e.e_id
group by
	e.e_id, e.name;

Another approach:
select e.e_id, e.name, mixed."No. of deps. assigned" from employee e, 
(
	select e.e_id, count(*) as "No. of deps. assigned" from employee e, work w
	where
		w.eid = e.e_id
	group by
		e.e_id
) mixed
where
	mixed.e_id = e.e_id;

[This 2nd approach may seem lengthy than the previous one that uses multiple fields after group by clause but it is much more simpler(easy to understand) and robust.
I used the term robust on purpose cause, as you know there is a restriction of using the group by clause that is you cannot use a field other than the one given
after the group by or some aggregate function, it becomes necessary to add multiple fields after the group by when you want to keep the aggregate output of the
group by query. But adding multiple fields after group by also adds its own restrictions. If you want to group by cityname and you want to keep some other fields,
say e_id or name along with the output of some aggregate function that is used after select keyword then you need to add that 'other field' after group by along with
cityname which may not behave as you want it to. Eventually this 2nd lengthy method becomes the ninja technique when showing other fields that are not given after
group by clause.]
